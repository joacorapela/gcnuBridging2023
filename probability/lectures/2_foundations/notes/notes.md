# Goals

- demonstrate that probability is deductive

- provide many examples of probability problems

- compare the analytical and simulation approach of computing probabilities

# Expected from introduction

- notion of random experiment

- histogram of outcomes from random experiments

- frequency-based interpretation of probability

# Source Tijms, 2012

# 7. History

- explain the frequency-based interpretation of probability.

- constructing the mathematical foundations of probability theory has proven to be a long-lasting process of trial an error.  

- the approach of defining probability as relative frequencies of repeatable experiments lead to unsatisfactory theory (why?)

- the frequency view of probability has a long history that goes back to Aristotle.

- in 1933 the Russian mathematician Andrej Kolmogrov (1903-1987) laid a satisfactory mathematical foundation of probability theory.

He created a set of axioms. Axioms state a number of minimal requirements that the probability objects should satisfy. From these few algorithms all claims of probability can be derived, as we will see.

# 7.1 Probabilistic foundation

- sample space
    - examples of finite, countable and uncountable
    - mention the proof by Cantor that the real numbers are not countable

# 7.1.1 Axioms of probability theory
- events in countable and uncountable sample spaces (hint abou sigma algebras)
- probability measure
    - three axioms
        - explain what an infinite union means
- probability space: sample space + events + probability measure = probability space
- building a probability measure for a finite or countable sample space.
- probability model = sample space + probability measure

## Equally likely outcomes
- examples
- uncountable sample space

# 7.3 Some basic rules
- Rules 7-1 to 7-3
- problems
    - example 7.7 (rule 7-2): Chevalier de Mere to Blaise Pascal 1654
    - example 7.8 (rule 7-3, addition rule, easy)
    - example 7.9 (rule 7-3): uses counting tools (binomial coefficient)
    - example 7.10 (rule 7-1): uses counting tools (binomial coefficient)

# 8 Conditional probability and Bayes

- p. 256: good motivation of conditional probability in the cards example

- Definition 8.1

- interpretation of condition probability with relative frequencies

- Example 8.1 (first ask students their intuition, as the problem is counter intuitive)

- do NOT present example 8.2 at this point, as it requires the concept of independence

* examples: 

    - rock paper scissors game
    - Efron's dice game

- probability axioms
* examples of probability derivations

# Conditional probability and Bayes

- conditional probability
- multiplication rule
- independent events
* law of conditional probability (with derivation)

# Random variables

- discrete versus continuous
- Examples

# Expected value and law of large numbers

- motivation of expected value with casino Huygens example
- definition of expected value for a discrete random variable
- example of expected value: best-choice problem
    - derivation of the solution
    * simulation of the solution (law of large numbers)
