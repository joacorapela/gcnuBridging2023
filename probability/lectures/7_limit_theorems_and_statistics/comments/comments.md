- The material is great.

- It may be a bit boring for students to spend the whole day in the Socratic lecture style.

- I would intercalate problem sessions and give students many breaks

- Discuss the different types of stochastic convergence and their relationship?

- The example in section 7-4 from Papoullis and Pillai is very good to demonstrate the relevance of the Chebyshev's inequality and the relevance of averaging.

WLLN doc:

    - Prop 2.3 from Ross 2010

        If Var(X)=0 then P(X=E(X)) = 1

CLT doc:

    - Q2: \mu should be different from zero for Sn to increase as n increases

    - Q5: the Cauchy distribution does not have finite variance and the CLT does not hold

classical stats

    - Q7: are you assuming \theta is a scalar? If not, what norm are you using to define small?

    - A9: g(X) should be g(X;\theta)

    - in Q11 you may want to clarify that the convergence of a consisten estimator should be in probability
