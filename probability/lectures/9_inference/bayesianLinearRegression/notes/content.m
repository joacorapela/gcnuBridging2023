# 2.3 The Gaussian distribution

- 1D Gaussian -> MD Gaussian

- motivation

    - maximum entroy distribution for given mean and covariance

    - CLT (Simon Laplace inventor in 1810,  Adolphe Quetelet used it to show
    that soldier's chest girths follow a Gaussian distribution)

    - biography of Gauss

- mathematical description of ellipses

- eigenvalue transformation makes Gaussian random variables independent
    - uncorrelated Gaussian random variables are independent

- ellipsoid representation of Gaussian

- in the eigenvectors basis, correlated Gaussian random variables become
uncorrelated (i.e., independent)

- limitations of the Gaussian

    - overparametrized

        - overcoming overparametrizations (diagonal covariance, scaled identity)

    - unimodal

        - discrete latent variables: mixture of Gaussians

        - continuous latent variables: 

            - markov Random fields (images),

            - linear dynamical system (time series)

    - graphical models: language for describing joint distributions
