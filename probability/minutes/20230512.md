# Agenda

- introductions

- structure of lectures:
    - morning   -- 2 hours lecture: concepts + problems descriptions
    - afternoon -- 3 hours for students to review lecture and solve problems
    - afternoon -- 1 hour tutorial discussing with students solutions to problems and/or concepts from lecture

    - if we run out of time in the lecture we could use some time in the afternoon to continue
    - Modhi's suggestion of alternating 20 minutes of lecture with 20 minutes of problem solution

- material to prepare: teaching notes (e.g., slides) + problem sets + solutions

- share prepared material:
    - get comments from others
    - helping TAs

- challenge coordination:
    - share dependencies
    - pair with other lecturers to get/offer feedback (e.g., pair with the lecturers of a lectures on which your lectures depends)

- my style borrowed from Wilson
    - lectures notes with Appendices
    - problems with helper code
