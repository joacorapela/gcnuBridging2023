# Attendance

- Alberto

- Modhi

- George 

- Cameron (arrived at the end, but he will share a few suggestions about connecting functions of random variables with ML applications -- e.g., normalizing flows).

- Joaquin

James could not joins because he was sick and Laurence could not come because he was busy.

# Items discussed

- George discussed a few ideas about his Limit Theorems lecture. He decided not to cover the strong law of large numbers.

- We agreed on not cover moment generating functions.

- Joaquin mentioned that he will solve probability problems analytically and by simulation. George suggested that he mentions that the simulation approach works due to a law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.

# Next steps

- Wed May 31: all-modules group meeting

- Fri June 2: probability group meeting

    - discuss if/how to change things following the feedback from the all-modules group meeting

    - Cameron: structure of his Function of Random Variables lecture

    - Alberto and Joaquin: more detailed information (e.g., flow of the lecture, problem sets) on the first two lectures.
