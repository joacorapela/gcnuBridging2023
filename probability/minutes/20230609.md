# Attendance

- Alberto

- Mohi (remotely)

- Laurence

- Cameron

- Joaquin

George did not join us because he did not see the Zoom link, and James could not come because he is in France in a wedding.

# Items discussed

- Laurence showed us slides from his **Joint pdfs** lecture. His slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1INBnOvhVaFcXYYc0IjdYVYj6Q5_aAkY-E8wsTibkS0g/edit#slide=id.g244d085e5d5_0_3167).

- Cameron commented about his **Discrete random variables** lecture. He will push his slides to the repo soon.

    - highlighted that we want to agree on a standard notation:

        - capital letters by the end of the alphabet for random variables (e.g., X),

        - lowercase letters by the end of the alphabet for samples (e.g., x),

        - capital letters by the begining of the alphabet for events (e.g., A).

    - Alberto suggested to Cameron to use the Geometric distribution.

    - Cameron and Joaquin may want to use similar examples.

- Mohi showed us her slide for her **Random vectors** lecture. Her slices can be found [here](https://github.com/joacorapela/gcnuBridging2023/blob/master/probability/lectures/6_vectorsOfRandomVariables/randomVectors/Random_Vectors_Gatsby_Bridging_Programme.pdf).
